If I were paying more attention – and had planned any part of this trip – I would’ve known that today is the opening day of the exhibition, and that she was there to give a talk about her work. Free admission, too.

Nevermind, today I discovered an artist whose work is right up my Straße, possibly inspiring a new side-project. Bought the exhibition catalogue as eager to dig deeper and learn more.
