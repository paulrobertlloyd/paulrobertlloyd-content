Reading about [the new identity for BBC Cricket](https://www.underconsideration.com/brandnew/archives/new_identity_and_on_air_look_for_bbc_cricket_by_happy_ending.php), realise that I now much prefer the newer blocks logo to the old one. I didn’t take to it originally, but thought best to reserve judgement. Not only is it bolder and more balanced, it’s also wiped away the unsightly stain of Gill, which is no bad thing either.
