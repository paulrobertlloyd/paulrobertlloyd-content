I don’t often recommend hotels, or make return visits, but just checked out of [Hotel Casa](https://hotelcasa.nl) in Amsterdam for the third time. I love staying here; it’s modern and stylish with a lovely cafe, restaurant and rooftop terrace. Located outside the canal ring, it’s relatively peaceful, too. I’ll be back!
