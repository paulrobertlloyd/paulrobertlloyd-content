[""Le Man’s ’66""](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1950186/) (aka ""Ford v Ferrari"") is beautifully shot and unexpectedly comical in places, but any enjoyment is given pause by its vivid depiction of the often tragic consequences of motorsport, particularly during that era. “Sometimes they don’t get out of the car.”
