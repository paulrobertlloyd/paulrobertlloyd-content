Going to miss [Gladiators](https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m001vfg8), the rebooted series having fast become essential Saturday night telly. There’s been some really close competitions, with contenders competing against a brilliant new cast of Glads; Legend’s post event interviews often had me crying with laughter. Bring on series 2!
