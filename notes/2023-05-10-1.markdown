Lovely evening over at Lewes Depot to watch ""The Big Lebowski"" again, but this time on the big screen. Such a fun story with crazy characters, backed up by a brilliant cast with superb direction. Also, and only just realised this, Roger Deakinâ€™s cinematography, too. The perfect movie? The Dude abides.
