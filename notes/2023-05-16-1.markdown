Watched all 8 episodes of [""Colin from Accounts""](https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episodes/p0f255x9/colin-from-accounts) yesterday evening. Brilliantly written with crude humour in places, the story grabs your attention and doesnâ€™t let go. Plus it has a Border Terrier in a leading role. Reminded me a little bit of ""Catastrophe"", which is no bad thing.
