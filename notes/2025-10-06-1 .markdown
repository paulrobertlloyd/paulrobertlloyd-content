Trying to buy tickets for a major tourist attraction in Barcelona. Three separate attempts fail to complete (session expired). Go to the attraction hoping to buy tickets in person; online purchases only. When speak to an official, tells me to use Google Chrome (Iâ€™m using an iPhone, which is a whole other issue but needless to say, this is not an option).

Just a small, insignificant example of how this century has rapidly turned into a techno-centric idiocracy.
