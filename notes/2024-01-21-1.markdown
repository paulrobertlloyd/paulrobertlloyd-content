I really hope [HISBE can get back on their feet](https://www.theargus.co.uk/news/24044484.hisbe-brighton-worthing-supermarket-confirms-money-woes/). Not only because I depend on them for my many refills (and with it my much reduced consumption of plastic), but I think their model of local, ethical and sustainable shopping makes a lot of sense.
