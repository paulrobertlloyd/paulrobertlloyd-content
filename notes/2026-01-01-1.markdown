Today I… stayed up to watch the finale of ""Stranger Things"" (and wasn’t disappointed), took a morning walk with old friends, spent the afternoon with both my godmother and goddaughter and concluded it by getting hooked onto new series of ""The Traitors"" and ""The Night Manager"". Pretty good start to 2026, I’d say.
