While it meant watching the Monaco Grand Prix from a rain-drenched Walthamstow rather than the sun-kissed French Rivera as originally planned, was lovely to see @cennydd@twitter.com and @anna_debenham@twitter.com again after so long. Fingers crossed weâ€™ll finally make it to Monte Carlo next year.
