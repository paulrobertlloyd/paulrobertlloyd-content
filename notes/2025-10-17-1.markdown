The concourse at Euston station is now a festival of Rail Alphabet 2. Yet move beyond that andâ€¦ well, God knows what font has been chosen for the gantries above the approaches to platforms (which themselves still use NR Brunel). One day there might be some visual coherence on the railway, but today is not that day.
