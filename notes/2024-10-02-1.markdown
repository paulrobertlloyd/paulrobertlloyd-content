Kinda wild watching a person sat on the train next to me using Twitter, and then posting an emotive, implicitly pro-Elon reply. Anyway, curiosity got the better of me and I logged in for the first time in ages; the site is unrecognisable, overflowing with spammy ads and pornography, with a user base of boiled frogs digging ever deeper trenches in one man’s manufactured culture war. It’s all very sad, bizarre and dare I say it, weird.
