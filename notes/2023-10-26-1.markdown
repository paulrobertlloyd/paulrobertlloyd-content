A beautifully unexpected series of talks at border:none today. With the theme of retrospection and finding our place in the world, at times the talks were very personal and deeply moving. That being said, Iâ€™m planning on skipping the sessions tomorrow morning so that I can visit the [DB Museum](https://dbmuseum.de/en/nuremberg)! ðŸš‚
