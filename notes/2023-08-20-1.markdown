Passed over, under and through the Alps having departed Como to arrive here in Zürich, the penultimate stop of my trip. Lots more to say about my travels through just a small part of Italy, and maybe I’ll write about them soon. But once again, as soon as I find myself in a German-speaking part of the world, I feel like I’m with my people. I’m already home.
