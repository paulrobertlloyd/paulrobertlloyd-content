[Slapdashery][1] was a writing challenge undertaken by [Ben Sauer][2] in 2017.

Every day, he would write a short post about design, user experience and products, writing for 5 minutes without stopping:

> This is my attempt to work the unnatural, unfiltered, uninhibited way, and get better at writing by force of habit. I hope that in my attempt to build better habits and writing, something falls out of me that’s useful to you.
> — [Ben Sauer on his motivation for writing Slapdashery][3]

Planning to publish these posts on Medium, Ben asked me to design a logo that could be used for the publication’s logo and avatar.

In the spirit of the project, I too decided to create something within a limited time span, hoping something would fall out of the process that would be useful to Ben. This is the logo I arrived at:

![The Slapdashery logo.](/media/projects/slapdashery/logo.svg "The Slapdashery logo.")

Each letter was composed using the shapes left having cut in half a square, a circle and a triangle. No doubt the mark could be refined, but in the spirit of the project, I stopped fiddling once I reached an hour’s worth of effort.

> This is truly wonderful, I’m very grateful. Love the style of it; a nod to the slapdash, but far from it.
> — Ben Sauer
