[Universal Networks][1] encompasses NBCUniversal’s portfolio of over seventy international television channels. In 2009, these were consolidated into five brands – Syfy, Diva, 13th Street, Studio Universal and Universal Channel – and NBCUniversal wanted to create a holistic online user experience that all these brands could use within each territory in which they were operated.

Working with James Box at Clearleft, I devised the underlying user experience and design language, expressed as a library of localisable design patterns. These were customisable, allowing each brand to exhibit its own individuality and brand personality. I provided styling for four of these, while Aegir Hallmundur designed the theme for Diva.
