Named after the teamâ€™s founding product manager, _Kahar the elephant_ is representative of strength, wisdom and memory. His different coloured eyes represent both the diversity initiatives the team advocates, as well as Get into teaching (green) and Becoming a teacher (blue), the two services covered. His trunk is decorated with a rocket, the unofficial symbol of the squad.
