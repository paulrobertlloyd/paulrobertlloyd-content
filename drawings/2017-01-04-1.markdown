A little logo I cooked up for Ben Sauer’s new writing project, [Slapdashery](https://slapdashery.org). Each letter is composed using the shapes left having cut in half a square, a circle and a triangle. No doubt the mark could be refined, but in the spirit of the project, I stopped fiddling once I reached an hour’s worth of effort.
