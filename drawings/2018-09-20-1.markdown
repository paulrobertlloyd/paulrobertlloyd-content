As I look to redesign my website, one goal has been to review my logo. The current slanted ‘PRL’ mark evolved from [earlier concepts I posted back in 2014](https://dribbble.com/shots/1568425) – some of which are more interesting than what I eventually settled on, actually.

Anyway, stumbling upon a [Pilcrow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pilcrow), I wondered if I could integrate my three initials into that symbol, and ended up here. Thoughts?
