The lack of a consistent identity around the different IndieWeb protocols has long frustrated me, and every now and again I find myself noodling on some ideas. This evening I think I’ve landed on something I’m pretty happy with.

Clockwise, from top left: IndieAuth, Micropub, Microsub, Vouch, Webmention and Microformats (the existing logo repurposed in the new style).
