Returning to the conundrum that is the logo for my website, think I’ve landed on something interesting. Constructed of three rectangles and two circles, and placed on a pixel grid, this shape scales down really well to super small sizes. This is important as this will exclusively feature as the site’s favicon, at least for now.
