Katya is an excellent user research who until recently was one of our delivery team’s longest serving members. To celebrate her time with us, we decided to create a ‘mission patch’ in her honour. Drawing on Russian constructivism (namely the work of [Alexander Rodchenko](https://www.artsy.net/series/art-history-101/artsy-editorial-constructivism-brought-russian-revolution-art)), I knocked up this sticker.
