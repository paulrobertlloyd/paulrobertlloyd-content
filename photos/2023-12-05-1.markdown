I’ve always thought that [the ‘p’ in the current iteration of my logo](https://dribbble.com/shots/5517702) is too heavy in comparison to the other letters. That, and it breaks with the simplicity of constructing initials using simple shapes only. I think this slight change improves things considerably.
