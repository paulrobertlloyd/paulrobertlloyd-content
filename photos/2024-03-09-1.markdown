Completely overwhelmed by day 1 of IndieWebCamp Brighton. Amazing turnout, of mostly first-time attendees, engaged in diverse discussions that examined subjects like how to memorialise a personal website after death and sharing pain points of hosting, writing and syndicating content online. Clearly thereâ€™s an appetite for the indie web, and for making it more accessible, too.
