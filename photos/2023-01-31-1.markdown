Almost 3 years since it was first proposed, today the summary card officially became [part of the GOV.UK Design System](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/components/summary-list/#summary-cards).

Many thanks to Paul Hayes, who helped conceive the original design, and to Tim, Chris, Calvin, Owen and others at GDS for shepherding this contribution through the approval process.

Right then, whatâ€™s next?
