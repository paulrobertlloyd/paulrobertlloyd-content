The release of @manton@manton.org’s [new notes app](https://www.manton.org/2024/02/13/introducing-notes-in.html) got me thinking about the icons for [these different companion apps](https://apps.apple.com/gb/developer/micro-blog-llc/id1253201334), and how they might look if they were designed to appear more like a family.

Too closely related? Possibly, but there’s something in this, I think.
