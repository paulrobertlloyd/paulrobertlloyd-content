Here are some things I’ve been able to count for 2025. [As usual][1], I’m showing these alongside counts for the previous 4 years as well as some light commentary for added context.

## Posts

| Year | Articles | Notes | Photos | Total |
| ---- | -------: | ----: | -----: | ----: |
| 2025 |       11 |    18 |      9 |    38 |
| 2024 |       11 |    35 |     42 |    88 |
| 2023 |       23 |    38 |     50 |   111 |
| 2022 |       11 |    69 |     32 |   112 |
| 2021 |        4 |    47 |     77 |   128 |

A significant drop in the amount of stuff I posted to this website over the last year. This was due to me posting fewer notes (reflective of my decreasing use of social media where notes are often syndicated), but I also didn’t share many photos, nor join any photo challenges. But, [inspired by Diamond Geezer][2], lets add a new count…

## Photos taken

| Year | Commits |
| ---- | ------: |
| 2025 |    1009 |
| 2024 |     796 |
| 2023 |     996 |
| 2022 |    1086 |
| 2021 |     943 |

Looking at the number of photos saved to my library, the number I take each year is reasonable consistent. I guess I just need to share more of them here.

## Travel

| Year | Countries | Trips | Distance | Carbon |
| ---- | --------: | ----: | -------: | -----: |
| 2025 |         4 |    13 |  5713 km | 271 kg |
| 2024 |         3 |    15 |  8742 km | 287 kg |
| 2023 |         6 |    22 |  6439 km | 215 kg |
| 2022 |         6 |    13 |  8093 km | 263 kg |
| 2021 |         1 |     4 |  1624 km |  54 kg |

My travel patterns remain consistent, at least when there’s not a global pandemic.

Unlike previous years, [my late summer holiday in 2025][3] involved sun, a beach, hotel pool and, importantly, no laptop! While tempted to do the same again this year, I’ve got a list of places I’d like to visit ([Miniatur Wunderland][4] in Hamburg, [Bob Brickman’s Lego museum][5] in Rosenheim and possibly [Kirby Konf][6] in Mainz) that may give 2026 a familiar German flavour.

## Events

| Year | Cinema | Other | Total |
| ---- | -----: | ----: | ----: |
| 2025 |      5 |    10 |    15 |
| 2024 |      6 |    14 |    20 |
| 2023 |      5 |    13 |    18 |
| 2022 |      7 |     9 |    16 |
| 2021 |      4 |     7 |    11 |

Somehow I went to fewer events in 2025, which surprises me a little. I saw 3 plays (""Elektra"", ""Giant"" and ""Nye""), saw [Haim][7] live and enjoyed an unexpected [Mark and Lard][8] reunion. I’d also bought tickets to see Martin Parr at the Brighton Festival, only to get distracted and miss the event. [Kicking myself][9].

## Contributions to repos on GitHub

| Year | Commits |
| ---- | ------: |
| 2025 |    2013 |
| 2024 |    2760 |
| 2023 |    4040 |
| 2022 |    4295 |
| 2021 |    3047 |

The numbers GitHub reports have seemingly changed since I recorded them last year, so I have no idea how reliable these are. Regardless of raw figures, I spent too much of my spare time in a code editor, much of it for work or work-adjacent projects, which wasn’t particularly clever.

## Activities on Strava

| Year | Cycling | Running | Swimming | Weights |   Total |
| ---- | ------: | ------: | -------: | ------: | ------: |
| 2025 |  3h 12m |  1h 00m |   6h 13m | 56h 15m | 66h 40m |
| 2024 |  0h  0m |  3h 26m |   2h  9m |  8h  0m | 13h 35m |
| 2023 |  0h  0m |  0h  0m |   3h 46m |  0h  0m |  3h 46m |
| 2022 |  4h  2m |  0h  0m |   6h 21m |  0h  0m | 10h 23m |
| 2021 | 20h 37m | 19h 50m |   0h  0m |  0h  0m | 40h 27m |

Towards the end of 2024 I had an overly ambitious plan to run 3 days a week and swim once a week or more, but 2025 was the year I fell in love with weight lifting, ultimately spending 2 hours a week building up my strength and endurance.

In September I attempted my first Deka fitness competition, [Atlas][10] but only completed 4 stations. I completed the [Strong][11] in December but with a truly embarrassing time. Regardless, I’ve set myself the audacious goal of completing the Atlas within the 30 minute time limit before the year is out.

## Check-ins on Swarm

| Year | Check-ins |
| ---- | --------: |
| 2025 |       295 |
| 2024 |       928 |
| 2023 |      1008 |
| 2022 |       941 |
| 2021 |       785 |
| 2020 |       623 |

In 2024 [I wondered why I continued to use Swarm][12]. With that in mind I decided to check-in only when visiting new places. You can see the result. Now that Swarm no longer has a web interface, and needing to count the number of check-ins in 2025 by hand, I may be ready to delete the app entirely. Let’s see if I manage this when we return to these counts in 12 months time.
