I’ll be speaking at Peckham Digital’s [3rd Festival of Creative Computing][1] next Friday, 19 July.

Here’s the pitch for my talk, ""The Web We Want: A Beginner’s Guide to the IndieWeb"":

> The web was intended as a medium for collaboration, compassion and creativity. Today, with control consolidated within the hands of a few corporations and communication reliant on their centralised services, instead we witness a means of sowing disinformation, polarisation and division.
>
> The IndieWeb is a people-focused alternative to the corporate web, a place where you own your identity, retain control of your content and enjoy the freedom to create whatever you like without the constraints imposed by companies concerned only with engagement and the needs of investors.
>
> In this talk, we’ll explore the different ways people are expressing themselves on the IndieWeb and how you can join them.

I’ve got an hour, and in that time I hope to give a brief history of the web and explain how you can maintain control and ownership of your work and identity online. I may even have some time to demo publishing to my website using IndieWeb building blocks, before taking any questions.

[Tickets are free][2], and the talk starts at 6pm at [The Hub][3]. See you there!
