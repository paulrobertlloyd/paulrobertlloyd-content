I’m bored of it.

The pervasive, all encompassing nature of it.

The inevitable, dehumanising consequence of it.

That there’s a ‘there’ there to it.

Rubbish in and rubbish out of it.

Nobody asked for it, and nobody wants it.

The best minds of my generation thinking about how to make people use it.

That you should just accept it.

A thousand no’s, but ‘yes’ when shareholders start clamouring for it.

Policy-makers pandering to it.

A decommissioned nuclear power station required to power it.

Not to mention millions of gallons of water required to cool it.

Every article glorifying it.

Every article vilifying it.

Every pub conversation winding up talking about it.

People incessantly telling you how _they_ use it.

I feel dirty using it.

You know what I’m talking about, even though I’ve not mentioned it.

And that’s why I’m bored of it.
