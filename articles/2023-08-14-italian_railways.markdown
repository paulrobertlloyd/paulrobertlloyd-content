- Many mainline stations look like airports thanks to their long departure halls with high ceilings. I’ve found this to be the case at [Torino’s Porta Susa][1] and [Porta Nova][2], and thought this to be especially true when I visited [Roma Termini][3] many years ago.

- That’s not the case in Milan. [Milano Centrale][4] is not just a cathedral to the railways, but several. Honestly, I can’t adequately describe the shear fucking size of this building. It’s almost taking the piss[^1].

- From my very limited experience, you can find ticket office staff working 7pm on a Sunday – [unimaginable in England][5].

- Ticket machines offer instructions in different languages. If you select English ([represented by a Union Flag icon][6]), it loudly announces that you should be aware of pickpockets, thus alerting every nearby pickpocket to your presence.

- Tracks are often painted white, something I suspect [will become a common sight][7] closer to home, given global boiling.

- The trains mostly [run on time][8].
