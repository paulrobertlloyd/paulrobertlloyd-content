First [Manton][1] did it, then a [few][2] [others][3] on [Micro.blog][4] followed. Ever one to jump on a bandwagon, I thought I’d list the countries I’ve visited as well.

That’s 28 countries in total, not counting those I’ve travelled through during transit (United Arab Emirates and Thailand by plane, Slovakia by train). Here’s [every trip I’ve taken](/trips).

Asia and Africa are clearly big gaps, though hard to fill given I avoid flying due to its carbon footprint. Southeastern Europe remains unexplored, and I’ve yet to visit every territory within the British Isles.

Plenty of places to visit then, if I want to add to this list.
