[Paul McCartney - I’ve Got a Feeling (feat. John Lennon)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4UsXksoGNg)

I really enjoyed Paul McCartney’s headline performance at Glastonbury on Saturday. Spanning much of his life’s work, apart from the earlier hits, turns out I wasn’t familiar with entire chunks of it.

This might be in part because I grew up in a family where the Beatles didn’t feature. My mum was a Stones fans growing up, not much bothered by Beatles mania (a particular point of pride for my brother).

Having enjoyed [""Get Back""][1] earlier this year, and now rummaging through [Macca’s back catalogue][2], I feel like I’m playing catch up.

Watching his performance I felt a pang of sadness. It’s unlikely I’ll ever see this iconic yet 80-year old artist perform live in front of me. And then I remembered – I already have!

It was at the closing ceremony of the 2012 Olympic Games, where Paul closed out the occasion with, well, [you know][3]. I suspect this memory may have faded given I was there with my mum, the noise of her eyes rolling drowning out the strained vocals of this former Beatle.
