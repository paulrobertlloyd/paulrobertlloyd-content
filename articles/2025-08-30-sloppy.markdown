Last month, somebody at work put the government’s 10 Year Health Plan for England through Google Notebook LM and had it generate a 13 minute podcast.

I didn’t listen to it.

Last week, I found myself in an a video conference in which a developer tried to describe the component they wanted to build by pasting the entire output of an AI chatbot into the meeting’s chat.

I didn’t read it (although I did almost fall off my chair).

Last weekend, a neighbour posted a 17-page PDF into my street’s WhatsApp group summarising the potential downsides of local government reorganisation (“these are not my own thoughts and opinions, they are suggestions from AI”).

I didn’t read any of that, either.

I guess I’m applying the inverse of [Simon’s rule](https://simonwillison.net/2023/Aug/27/wordcamp-llms/#personal-ai-ethics): I will not consume anything that will take me longer to read than it took for someone to write.

(Again, please, [make it stop][1]).
