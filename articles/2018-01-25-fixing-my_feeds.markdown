After reading [Robin’s re-introduction to RSS](https://robinrendle.com/notes/how-to-read-the-internet/), I decided to make [Feedbin](https://feedbin.com/) my feed manager of choice. I had been using a self-hosted instance of [Fever](https://feedafever.com) for many years, but since this is no longer supported, I moved[^1] my subscriptions over to [Feedly](https://feedly.com) at the beginning of the year.

As a piece of software that operates mainly in the background – [Reeder](https://reederapp.com) is where I spend most of my day – I was willing to put up with Feedly’s many quirks. But then I tried Feedbin. The difference between the two is like night and day. Feedbin is not only usable, but damn right gorgeous to boot! I guess the adage is true: you get what you pay for.

This move has prompted some other RSS related news, in that I’ve fixed my XML and JSON feeds, and redirected legacy URLs to their canonical locations. It can’t have been fun subscribing to my site recently, as I fiddled and fumbled while [adding support for micro posts][1]. I think I’m happy with everything now, but no promises.

Anyway, for the avoidance of doubt, you can subscribe to my site using your syndication format of choice:

- <https://paulrobertlloyd.com/feed.xml> (Atom XML)
- <https://paulrobertlloyd.com/feed.json> (JSON Feed)

How very Web 2.0.
