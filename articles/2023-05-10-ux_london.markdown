I’m excited to share that I’ll be speaking at this year’s [UX London][1] about, you guessed it, [design histories][2]. Given this platform and wider audience, I plan to use this as an opportunity to dig deeper into documenting design decisions, why we should, and how we can.

I also hope to share a few thoughts about giving teams an identity, celebrating achievements and curating an inclusive culture. Basically, lessons learned and ideas uncovered from 4 years working within government. This sometimes feels like a world away from the rest of the industry, so it’ll be interesting to see how the talk lands.

If this or any of the other [sessions][3] sound interesting, join me on 22 – 23 June at Tobacco Dock in East London. [Grab a ticket][4] and use the code `JOINPAUL` to get a 20% discount. Hope to see you there!
