Is 2024 the year of the personal website? Perhaps it’ll see the federated social web go mainstream. Maybe a resurgence in RSS? One thing’s for sure, after more than a decade of consolidation, [the Internet is about to get weird again][1]. The perfect moment then, to bring IndieWebCamp back to Brighton on [the weekend of 9 and 10 March][2].

A lot has changed since [the last camp was held here in 2019][3]. There’s a growing interest in alternative approaches to social media, but also the threat of misinformation and inauthentic content being generated (and regurgitated) at awesome scale. And yet, some things haven’t changed, with incumbents continuing to mistreat users, giving scant regard to their privacy or safety.

IndieWebCamps are a wonderful opportunity to learn about how you can take back control of your content and online identity, and discuss new ideas for doing so with fellow citizens of the World Wide Web. Importantly, they are a combination of learning and making, turning theory into practice – and everyone’s invited.

Not got a personal website? Bring your laptop or mobile device, and we’ll help you get setup so that you can publish somewhere you control and can make your own.

Seasoned web developer? Learn about the different open web services, software and technologies that can help empower yourself and others to own their content and online identity.

Our venue is small, which means we have a limited capacity; if you want to attend in person, [grab a ticket today][4]. Otherwise, add yourself to the [list of remote attendees][5] on the IndieWebCamp wiki page, which is also where you can [learn more about the event][2]. Hope to see you there!
