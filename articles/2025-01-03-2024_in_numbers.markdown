Seeing as I [counted a few things last year][1], here are some of those same tables updated with values accrued over the last 12 months.

## Posts

| Year | Articles | Notes | Photos | Total |
| ---- | -------: | ----: | -----: | ----: |
| 2024 |       11 |    35 |     42 |    88 |
| 2023 |       23 |    38 |     50 |   111 |
| 2022 |       11 |    69 |     32 |   112 |
| 2021 |        4 |    47 |     77 |   128 |
| 2020 |       12 |    73 |     79 |   164 |

After a strong start to the year, motivated by all things IndieWeb, I found myself reluctant to post much at all in the second half of the year. My participation in Micro.blog’s photoblogging challenge in April contributed [30 posts][2], a third of the year’s total. Still unsure if this is a blip, or indicative of a trend away from publishing as much online.

## Travel

| Year | Countries | Trips | Distance | Carbon |
| ---- | --------: | ----: | -------: | -----: |
| 2024 |         3 |    15 |  8742 km | 287 kg |
| 2023 |         6 |    22 |  6439 km | 215 kg |
| 2022 |         6 |    13 |  8093 km | 263 kg |
| 2021 |         1 |     4 |  1624 km |  54 kg |
| 2020 |         8 |     7 |  4166 km | 136 kg |

Somehow I managed to travel to fewer places but over a greater distance. Much of this can be accounted for by separate trips to Germany and Austria; only my yearly trip to Amsterdam for CSS Day saw me venture elsewhere in Europe. Closer to home, two trips to Yorkshire and a wintery excursion to Inverness rounded out limited travel in 2024.

## Events

| Year | Cinema | Other | Total |
| ---- | -----: | ----: | ----: |
| 2024 |      6 |    14 |    20 |
| 2023 |      5 |    13 |    18 |
| 2022 |      7 |     9 |    16 |
| 2021 |      4 |     7 |    11 |
| 2020 |      3 |     5 |     8 |

Consistent with the year before. I’d like to attend more events and see more films this year; let’s see if I can push past 20.

## Commits on GitHub

| Year | Commits |
| ---- | ------: |
| 2024 |  10,112 |
| 2023 |    4087 |
| 2022 |    4295 |
| 2021 |    3050 |
| 2020 |    3324 |

This number perhaps best sums up 2024, although I’m not sure if the dramatic increase in commits takes into account the many obsessive compulsive rebases I made to maintain a clean commit history while rebuilding a prototype at work.

## Activities on Strava

| Year | Walking | Cycling | Running | Swimming |   Total |
| ---- | ------: | ------: | ------: | -------: | ------: |
| 2024 |  0h 56m |  0h  0m |  3h 26m |   2h  9m |  6h 31m |
| 2023 |  9h  4m |  0h  0m |  0h  0m |   3h 46m | 12h 50m |
| 2022 |  8h 32m |  4h  2m |  0h  0m |   6h 21m | 12h 34m |
| 2021 | 39h  4m | 20h 37m | 19h 50m |   0h  0m | 79h 31m |
| 2020 |  6h 14m | 13h 40m | 28h 16m |   0h  0m | 48h 10m |

Possibly a more accurate representation of exercise attempted, given 2023’s figures were skewed by [a 2-day walk across the South Downs][3]. But these figures don’t highlight a changed attitude to exercise I adopted in late October. I now regularly swim, run and weight train, so hopefully this year’s numbers will be comparable to those of the lockdown years.

## Check-ins on Swarm

| Year | Check-ins |
| ---- | --------: |
| 2024 |       928 |
| 2023 |      1008 |
| 2022 |       941 |
| 2021 |       785 |
| 2020 |       623 |

Why do I persist with this? Should I stop?
